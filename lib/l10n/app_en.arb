You are not allowed to use any part of the word when explaining, nor words with the same root. For example, the word 'bus' cannot be explained as 'automobile transportation vehicle'. You can say 'public transportation vehicle'.\n\nYou cannot explain the word 'banker' as 'a person who works in a bank', because 'bank' and 'banker' share the same root.\n\nWords cannot be explained in foreign languages unless the players agree on this before the game starts.\n\n4. The number of correctly guessed words equals the number of points. Mistakes and unclear words will deduct points.\n\n5. If 'Last word for all' is enabled, the word at the end of the time can be guessed by any team.\n\n6. A team wins when it earns enough points to win (defined in the settings).",
